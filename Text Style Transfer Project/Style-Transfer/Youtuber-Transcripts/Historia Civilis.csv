The province\xa0\nof Illyricum was on fire, and the\xa0\xa0', 'situation was getting so bad that it now\xa0\nrequired Octavian’s personal attention.  \n\xa0', 'Caesar should have intervened in Illyricum\xa0\n20 years ago - it had been his province back\xa0\xa0', 'in the day - but he completely neglected the\xa0\nadministration of the province in favour of his\xa0\xa0', '10 year crusade against the Gauls.

The good news was that due to Agrippa’s\xa0\ncareful planning, none of these setbacks were\xa0\xa0', 'catastrophic.

It was not\xa0\nuncommon for the Romans to march into a valley,\xa0\xa0', 'only to find every known mountain pass held\xa0\nby the enemy. Of course there were hidden\xa0\xa0', 'mountain passes, but the Romans didn’t know where\xa0\nthese were, only the enemy did. Meaning that the\xa0\xa0', 'Romans couldn’t keep their supply lines open,\xa0\nbut the enemy could. Each time this happened,\xa0\xa0', 'Octavian or Agrippa were forced into a costly\xa0\nengagement in order to fight their way free.  \n\xa0', 'Agrippa’s innovation was that he started\xa0\nto send large scouting parties to the\xa0\xa0', 'left and right of the army as it advanced. The\xa0\nscouts would leapfrog over each other and hold\xa0\xa0', 'open mountain passes so that the Romans\xa0\ncould always retreat if necessary.  \n\xa0', 'This almost mathematical caution forced the\xa0\npace of the campaign to slow to a crawl. What\xa0\xa0', 'was supposed to be a one year campaign dragged\xa0\ninto its second year, and then its third.  \n\xa0', 'Many of the details of the Illyrican campaign\xa0\nare lost, perhaps deliberately by people who\xa0\xa0', 'didn’t want us to know how bad it really\xa0\ngot, but two incidents really stand out. \n\xa0', 'The first was during an assault on a city. We’re\xa0\ntold that during the final assault, the bridge\xa0\xa0', 'that Octavian was standing on collapsed. He ended\xa0\nup in a heap of rubble just outside the enemy\xa0\xa0', 'wall, and had to be rescued by his soldiers.\xa0\nOne leg and both arms were badly injured.  \n\xa0', 'The second happened a year later, when a\xa0\nstone slung by a sling hit Octavian directly\xa0\xa0', 'in the knee, rendering him unable to walk for a\xa0\ntime. It was so bad that he could not be moved,\xa0\xa0', 'not even in a wagon. The entire army just had\xa0\nto sit there and wait for him to recover.  \n\xa0', 'These wounds probably stayed with\xa0\nOctavian for the rest of his life,\xa0\xa0', 'and they provide clues as to what is missing\xa0\nfrom the official story. In both accounts,\xa0\xa0', 'Octavian is painted in a sympathetic light,\xa0\nbut it’s noteworthy that the only good things\xa0\xa0', 'they had to say about him is that he had\xa0\ntwo near death experiences. It hints at a\xa0\xa0', 'troubled campaign. Perhaps the whole damn\xa0\nthing was a near death experience.  \n\xa0', 'The campaign was only supposed to\xa0\nlast for one year, but it dragged\xa0\xa0', 'on for three. It involved way more bloodshed\xa0\nthan anybody was expecting, and in the end it\xa0\xa0', 'involved negotiating more than 30 separate\xa0\npeaces with more than 30 separate groups,\xa0\xa0', 'each of whom had unique grievances and unique\xa0\ndemands that Octavian had to accommodate.  \n\xa0', 'In 33 B.C.E, Octavian and Agrippa declared\xa0\nvictory and returned to Rome. The Senate\xa0\xa0', 'awarded Octavian with a Triumph for the\xa0\ncampaign in Illyricum, but for political\xa0\xa0', 'reasons he decided to defer it to a later date.\xa0\nAnother hint that it was a troubled campaign.  \n\xa0', 'Per a pre-arranged deal with\xa0\nAntony, that year Octavian was\xa0\xa0', 'also elected consul for the second time.  \nHe resigned after one day, which may seem like\xa0\xa0', 'an unusual decision, but it was the beginning of a\xa0\ntrend that was slowly poisoning Roman politics.\n\xa0', 'Octavian was what’s known as a Consul Ordinarius,\xa0\nan Ordinary Consul, a consul who had been\xa0\xa0', 'elected through the normal process. Upon his\xa0\nresignation, a special election was called\xa0\xa0', 'in order to select a replacement consul known\xa0\nas a Consul Suffectus, a Suffect Consul.  \n\xa0', 'Elections for Suffect Consuls were only\xa0\nsupposed to be called upon the untimely\xa0\xa0', 'death of the Ordinary Consul, but now, just like\xa0\neverything else, that power was being abused.\n\xa0', 'Not only were the Ordinary Consuls resigning\xa0\nearly, but so were their replacements, and\xa0\xa0', 'even the replacements of the replacements.  \nIn a normal year, there were only supposed to be\xa0\xa0', 'two consuls. In the year 33, there were eight. And\xa0\nthis wasn’t just a one-off, this was a trend.\n\xa0', 'There were two benefits to appointing extra\xa0\nconsuls. The first was that it was an easy\xa0\xa0', 'way to reward political loyalists. The prestige\xa0\nthat came with being elected consul was immense,\xa0\xa0', 'people who had served as consul were\xa0\ntreated differently for the rest of\xa0\xa0', 'their lives. If a young upcoming politician\xa0\nwas closely related to a former consul,\xa0\xa0', 'that fact alone was often enough to get\xa0\nthem elected to a lower office.  \n\xa0', 'The second benefit was that former consuls got\xa0\nto speak first during debates in the Senate.\xa0\xa0', 'If it was a lively debate, former consuls were\xa0\noften the only people who got to speak which\xa0\xa0', 'meant that the nature of the debate between\xa0\nformer consuls could determine votes.  \n\xa0', 'By having a bunch of loyalists elected,\xa0\nOctavian was “stacking the bench” so to speak,\xa0\xa0', 'making it so that his people could dominate\xa0\nSenate debates and drown out any dissent.  \n\xa0', 'The trend of passing around consulships like they\xa0\nwere nothing would continue for hundreds of years.\xa0\xa0', 'Make no mistake, the Roman political\xa0\nsystem had been crumbling for a long time,\xa0\xa0', 'but this finally broke it beyond repair.\xa0\nThe Consul would become a mostly toothless\xa0\xa0', 'administrative role, and the real power\xa0\nwithin the Roman political system would\xa0\xa0', 'flow elsewhere.  \nWith the\xa0\xa0', 'conclusion of the war in Illyricum,\xa0\nOctavian and Agrippa turned their\xa0\xa0', 'focus to the situation in Rome.  \nBy 33 B.C.E, the vibes in Rome were abysmal.\xa0\xa0', 'There had just been a recession, a famine,\xa0\nand civil unrest. People were miserable.  \n\xa0', 'The two agreed that Agrippa should run\xa0\nfor Aedile for the year 33, the officer\xa0\xa0', 'responsible for public works and festivals.\xa0\nHe ran on a platform of cleaning up the city,\xa0\xa0', 'both literally and metaphorically, and\xa0\nnaturally, with Octavian’s backing, he won.\n\xa0', 'The problem facing the city was that for at\xa0\nleast 30 years, Rome had been dominated by\xa0\xa0', 'charismatic politicians who liked to run on big\xa0\nflashy promises at the expense of all the boring\xa0\xa0', 'stuff. Now, Agrippa was going to inject some life\xa0\ninto the city by tackling the boring stuff.  \n\xa0', 'The first on the list was the construction of a\xa0\nnew aqueduct to bring additional water into the\xa0\xa0', 'city, which he named the Aqua Julia in honour of\xa0\nhis boss. Remember, Octavian officially went by\xa0\xa0', 'the name of his adoptive father, Julius Caesar.\nThe new aqueduct ran 22 kilometers\xa0\xa0', 'up into the mountains.  \nWhat did he do with all this water?  \n\xa0', 'First, he flushed Rome’s sewer system, which\xa0\nwas not functioning properly and leaking and\xa0\xa0', 'making the whole city stink. Disgusting. Once it\xa0\nwas empty, he began some long needed structural\xa0\xa0', 'repairs. He then had the whole thing scrubbed\xa0\nclean, and put on a little publicity stunt\xa0\xa0', 'where he took a row boat through the sewers\xa0\nof Rome to prove how clean it now was.  \n\xa0', 'What else did he do with the water? He built 700\xa0\ncisterns and 150 water towers to further improve\xa0\xa0', 'water security, because, you know, even aqueducts\xa0\nwere susceptible to droughts and whatnot.  \n\xa0', 'He also built 500 public fountains that were\xa0\nunnecessarily beautiful, decorated in a unique\xa0\xa0', 'way with bronze and marble, so that everybody\xa0\nknew who was responsible for building them.  \n\xa0', 'When this project was done, virtually every\xa0\nhousehold in Rome was only a short walk away\xa0\xa0', 'from clean drinking water, which is a benchmark\xa0\nthat most big industrial cities were still\xa0\xa0', 'struggling to hit up into the 20th century.  \nAgrippa expanded upon this theme of “cleaning up\xa0\xa0', 'the city” by beginning construction of a massive\xa0\npublic bath complex, and announced that all\xa0\xa0', 'public baths would be free to use on basically\xa0\nevery other day during his term as Aedile.  \n\xa0', 'He even introduced a thing where the\xa0\ngovernment would provide citizens with\xa0\xa0', 'a free shave on public holidays.  \nHis whole program was aimed at pulling\xa0\xa0', 'Rome out of its funk and making the city\xa0\nmore beautiful, and we are told that he was\xa0\xa0', 'remarkably successful. Agrippa’s term as Aedile\xa0\nwas considered the greatest in living memory,\xa0\xa0', 'possibly the greatest ever. In one year as\xa0\na lowly Aedile, he accomplished more than\xa0\xa0', 'many of the consuls had over the preceding 30\xa0\nyears. And the people never forgot it.  \n\xa0', 'While all of this was going on, Octavian\xa0\nwas turning his eye to the east.\xa0\xa0', 'He set about deliberately and publicly\xa0\nworsening relations with Antony.  \n\xa0', 'He criticized Antony over the\xa0\nDonations of Alexandria business,\xa0\xa0', 'which was Antony’s plan for a re-structured Roman\xa0\neast, claiming that Antony had gone a little too\xa0\xa0', 'Egyptian living over there with Cleopatra.\nOctavian publicly teased Antony over his failed\xa0\xa0', 'campaign against Parthia, which was a little\xa0\nclose to home. Antony publicly mused about\xa0\xa0', 'Octavian’s betrayal of their “partner” Lepidus,\xa0\nwhich was also a little close to home.  \n\xa0', 'Octavian then commissioned and distributed\xa0\na pamphlet that claimed to prove with 100%\xa0\xa0', 'certainty that Caesarian, Caesar’s child by\xa0\nCleopatra, was not his true son. Antony responded\xa0\xa0', 'by saying that he had seen Caesar acknowledge\xa0\nthe boy as his son with his own eyes.  \n\xa0', 'Then things got personal. Octavian called\xa0\nAntony a drunk. Antony called Octavian a\xa0\xa0', 'gambling addict. Both accusations were true,\xa0\nby the way. Octavian shot back that the only\xa0\xa0', 'reason Antony didn’t like gambling was that\xa0\nhe was cursed with an unlucky spirit, which\xa0\xa0', 'honestly is a hilarious way to insult somebody. It\xa0\nwas also a little more subtle than it might seem.\xa0\xa0', 'One of the stories that Julius Caesar liked\xa0\nto tell about himself was that he was almost\xa0\xa0', 'supernaturally lucky. Octavian was saying\xa0\n“I have my father’s luck, and you don’t.”\xa0\xa0', 'Antony shot back making fun of Octaian\xa0\nfor marrying his wife Livia when she was\xa0\xa0', 'pregnant with another man’s child. Okay\xa0\nthat one’s just straight up mean.\n\xa0', 'At this point, Antony wrote to Octavian\xa0\nprivately. In a miraculous turn of events,\xa0\xa0', 'this letter was preserved in the Roman archives,\xa0\nand later Roman historians were able to reference\xa0\xa0', 'it and pass its contents along to us.  \nDisclaimer: I looked into it, and Antony’s\xa0\xa0', 'letter is written using the vulgar and low\xa0\nclass version of certain words, and so any\xa0\xa0', 'faithful translation should also be vulgar and\xa0\nlow class. A lot of translations don’t do this,\xa0\xa0', 'they use poetic or flowery language,\xa0\nbut those translations are misleading,\xa0\xa0', 'and the reason that they are misleading is that\xa0\nacademics are a bunch of prudes. In the interest\xa0\xa0', 'of accuracy I’m going to use a few naughty\xa0\nwords, and then in the interest of my own\xa0\xa0', 'prudishness I’m going to bleep them.  \nThis is Antony writing to Octavian.\n\xa0', '“What’s come over you? Is it that I am ****ing\xa0\nthe Queen? But she isn’t my wife, is she? It\xa0\xa0', 'isn’t as if it’s something new, is it? Or has\xa0\nit actually been going on for nine years now?\xa0\xa0', 'What about you then? Is Livia the only woman\xa0\nyou ****? Good luck to you if, when you read\xa0\xa0', 'this letter, you haven’t also ****ed Tertulla\xa0\nor Terentilla or Rufilla or Salvia Titsenia,\xa0\xa0', 'or all of them. Does it really matter\xa0\nwhere and in whom you stick your ****?”\n\xa0', 'I don’t recall that part being\xa0\nincluded in the movie.  \n\xa0', 'By the end of the year 33 B.C.E, the\xa0\nwell had been sufficiently poisoned.\xa0\xa0', 'Octavian and Antony were no longer on speaking\xa0\nterms. They were in uncharted waters now.  \n\xa0', 'In 32 B.C.E, as part of a pre-arranged agreement,\xa0\xa0', 'the two new consuls were to be Antony’s\xa0\nmen. But this deal had been worked out\xa0\xa0', 'in a much happier time. By 32, people\xa0\nwere after each other’s throats.  \n\xa0', 'One of the first things introduced by the new\xa0\nconsuls was legislation censuring Octavian\xa0\xa0', 'for trying to provoke a war. A friendly\xa0\nTribune of the Plebs vetoed the bill,\xa0\xa0', 'but the message was sent. Antony’s political\xa0\nallies were coming for Octavian.  \n\xa0', 'At the next Senate meeting, Octavian showed up\xa0\nflanked by veterans from the Illyricum campaign,\xa0\xa0', 'who, observers noted, were doing a\xa0\npoor job at concealing the daggers\xa0\xa0', 'hidden in their clothing.\nThe assassination of Julius\xa0\xa0', 'Caesar was still fresh in the minds of Rome’s\xa0\npolitical elite, even after all these years.\n\xa0', 'That evening, the two newly elected\xa0\nconsuls fled the city of Rome,\xa0\xa0', 'and joined Antony out east. Approximately\xa0\n1/3rd of the Senate went with them.\n\xa0', 'This was probably an unexpected setback for\xa0\nOctavian. Many have guessed that he would not\xa0\xa0', 'have made such an open threat if he had known\xa0\nthat he would split the Senate. Perhaps he\xa0\xa0', 'was not as popular as he thought.  \nNew elections were called to replace\xa0\xa0', 'the consuls that had fled, and surprise\xa0\nsurprise, Octavian’s candidates won.  \n\xa0', 'The new consuls and the remaining Senators\xa0\nthen agreed to strip Antony of all of his\xa0\xa0', 'formal powers, including his scheduled term\xa0\nas consul that was to begin next year.  \n\xa0', 'Somewhere around this time, Antony\xa0\ndivorced Octavian’s sister Octavia.\xa0\xa0', 'It’s unclear whether this was direct retaliation\xa0\nagainst Octavian or simply something that was a\xa0\xa0', 'long time coming, but either way the divorce came\xa0\nas a shock to Octavia. Antony apparently ordered\xa0\xa0', 'her and their two children removed from their home\xa0\nwith no warning. Octavia was pretty upset by this,\xa0\xa0', 'and rightfully so. She moved in with her\xa0\nbrother, where she assumed responsibility\xa0\xa0', 'for raising her two children from the marriage\xa0\nwith Antony, and also, somehow, two of Antony’s\xa0\xa0', 'children from previous marriages.  \nOctavian was pleased by the divorce. It\xa0\xa0', 'suited his purposes. He made it known to the\xa0\npublic that Antony had abandoned his wife and\xa0\xa0', 'four of his children. In his eyes, the divorce\xa0\nmeant that his plan was working. It meant that\xa0\xa0', 'relations with Antony were destabilizing. It\xa0\nwas time to take things to the next level.  \n\xa0', 'In the summer of 32, Octavian got\xa0\na tip from one of Antony’s former\xa0\xa0', 'allies that he might find the contents\xa0\nof Antony’s will interesting. The man\xa0\xa0', 'claimed to have served as witness the\xa0\nlast time Antony had it updated.\n\xa0', 'Wealthy Romans kept their wills in the Temple to\xa0\nVesta in the center of Rome. Vesta was the goddess\xa0\xa0', 'of the hearth, and the priestesses sworn to Vesta,\xa0\nknown as the Vestal Virgins, were entrusted with\xa0\xa0', 'tending to the sacred fire in the center of Rome,\xa0\nwhich could never be allowed to go out.  \n\xa0', 'The Vestal Virgins were considered some of the\xa0\nhighest status and most trustworthy religious\xa0\xa0', 'figures in Rome. Simply laying eyes on a Vestal\xa0\nVirgins was considered good luck. Harming one\xa0\xa0', 'meant instant death This reputation was enough for\xa0\nwealthy Romans to entrust them with their wills,\xa0\xa0', 'which were to be kept closely guarded, and only\xa0\nopened upon that wealthy Roman’s death.  \n\xa0', 'When Octavian learned that there was\xa0\nsomething interesting in Antony’s will,\xa0\xa0', 'he marched into the Temple of Vesta and demanded\xa0\nto see it. The Vestal Virgins were honourbound to\xa0\xa0', 'protect the will, and so they refused. Octavian\xa0\nresponded by ordering his goons into the temple,\xa0\xa0', 'who overpowered the Vestal Virgins,\xa0\nand took Antony’s will by force.\n\xa0', 'This was sacreligious in the extreme, and if the\xa0\nRoman legal system was functioning properly at\xa0\xa0', 'all, Octavian would have been put to death. Under\xa0\nthe Roman religion, the sacred fire was the heart\xa0\xa0', 'of the city. The mystical essence of the city.\xa0\nAnd now Octavian was in there roughing people up\xa0\xa0', 'for political gain. The symbolism is so strong\xa0\nthat I don’t even know what to do with it.  \n\xa0', 'People were appropriately outraged,\xa0\nbut that outrage quickly evaporated\xa0\xa0', 'when Octavian read Antony’s will\xa0\naloud at the next Senate meeting.\n\xa0', 'According to Octavian, Antony left\xa0\ninstructions for his body to be taken\xa0\xa0', 'to Alexandria after his death, so that he\xa0\ncould be buried alongside Cleopatra.\n\xa0', 'This was considered a shocking revelation, a\xa0\nbetrayal of Antony’s ancestors and a symbolic\xa0\xa0', 'renouncement of his Roman citizenship.\nAntony also recognized Caesarian as the\xa0\xa0', 'son of Julius Caesar, and recognized his\xa0\nchildren by Cleopatra as his legitimate heirs.\xa0\xa0', 'Antony had just thrown his own Roman children\xa0\nout onto the street, and now he was disinheriting\xa0\xa0', 'them in favour of a bunch of foreigners. This\xa0\nwas not only a betrayal, but it was strictly\xa0\xa0', 'illegal to do under Roman law.  \nOctavian summarized the contents of\xa0\xa0', 'the will by saying that Antony had basically\xa0\nbetrayed Rome. He framed Antony as an other,\xa0\xa0', 'as a foreigner, as an existential threat to\xa0\nRome. He also played up the idea that Cleopatra\xa0\xa0', 'had ambitions to conquer Rome, and was using\xa0\nAntony as a tool to realize these ambitions.\xa0\xa0', 'We know that Cleopatra had no such ambitions, and\xa0\nOctavian knew this too, but he said it anyway.\n\xa0', 'Octavian could not go to the Roman people and\xa0\nask them to support another Civil War. There\xa0\xa0', 'had been too much of that already, people\xa0\nwere exhausted. He had to frame Cleopatra\xa0\xa0', 'as an existential threat that endangered\xa0\nthe survival of the Roman state.  \n\xa0', 'Octavian’s little bit of propaganda,\xa0\nwith truth and lies all mixed together,\xa0\xa0', 'was remarkably effective at\xa0\nwinning over public opinion.  \n\xa0', 'In time, the Senate got behind Octavian and\xa0\nformally declared war. But they didn’t declare\xa0\xa0', 'war on Antony, and they didn’t declare war on\xa0\nEgypt. They declared war on Cleopatra, personally.\xa0\xa0', 'The irony of course was that they would\xa0\nhave to go through Antony and his Roman\xa0\xa0', 'legions to get to her.  \nIf you count Caesar,\xa0\xa0', 'and then Caesar’s assassins, and\xa0\nthen the thing with the Boat King,\xa0\xa0', 'this was the fourth major civil war in only 17\xa0\nyears. Many in the legions could not remember a\xa0\xa0', 'time when Rome was not at war with itself. And\xa0\nwhat did they have to show for it? The average\xa0\xa0', 'standard of living was lower than it had been 17\xa0\nyears ago. Roman politics were a shadow of what\xa0\xa0', 'they had once been. The capital city of the most\xa0\npowerful Empire in the Mediterranean could not\xa0\xa0', 'reliably keep its citizens fed or housed.  \nTo the average person, it felt like Rome was on\xa0\xa0', 'the decline, and that the entire system was just\xa0\none wrong step away from complete collapse.  \n\xa0', 'Octavian was reckless to provoke this\xa0\nconflict with Antony. If things tipped\xa0\xa0', 'a certain direction, it could have been\xa0\nthe end of the whole experiment.  \n\xa0', 'But things didn’t tip in that direction,\xa0\nand we’ll see why in a future video.']"

emanated\nfrom cities and business and capital, while', 'Tory political power emanated from aristocratic\nlandowners and the countryside.', 'At the time, the Whig modernist and pro-business\nworldview called for free trade and religious', 'toleration, alongside a slow and steady expansion\nof political rights.', 'The Whigs had a general distaste for slavery\nin all its forms, even while they

actually\nmade elections competitive again, and in the', '1770s Britain elected its first Whig Prime\nMinister from the conservative sub-faction.', 'During the French Revolution - perhaps in\nreaction

reasons Castlereagh thought this\nway is because he was an imperialist.', 'As Hobsbawm said, Britain at this time was\nvirtually the only colonial power in the world.', ""Some of the more liberal

Castlereagh\ngenuinely wanted peace.', 'The British public had been exhausted by the\nwar, and if the conservative Whigs wanted', 'to maintain their majority, they were going\nto have to show some results.', 'Together, Liverpool and Castlereagh came up\nwith a list of specific goals for the upcoming', 'negotiations.', 'The most important item was that they wanted\nthe Netherlands re-formed and strengthened', 'on the English Channel.', 'Two reasons for this.', 'First, they wanted an ally on the continent\nto break up any consolidation along the coast.', 'Second, this was historically a natural path\nfor French expansion, and going forward, the', 'British wanted to cut that off.', 'Along these same lines, they also wanted the\nFrench out of Spain, and Spain restored to', 'its previous borders under its previous monarch.', 'Castlereagh also had instructions to make\nsure that the new peace deal would keep Italy', 'free from French influence.', 'Historically, every time the French started\nmessing around with Italy, it meant that France', 'was becoming way too powerful.', 'No more.', 'Going forward, Italy would be a red line.', 'Castlereagh had other goals as well, but the\nbig ones were all about containing France.', 'Before the peace negotiations began, Castlereagh\nbackchanneled his list of priorities to both', 'Austria and Prussia and got from them an unofficial\nthumbs up.', ""At least two of the other Great Powers wouldn't\noppose any of Britain's big ticket items,"", ""and France wasn't exactly in a place to put\nup much of a fight."", 'The only remaining unknown going into the\nnegotiations was Russia.', 'Nobody quite knew what they wanted or what\ntheir intentions were.', 'When Castlereagh met Tsar Alexander of Russia\nfor the first time, he wrote to his Prime', 'Minister that he believed that the Russian\nmonarch was not of sound mind.', ""It's difficult to characterize Tsar Alexander,\nbecause it seems that most of his mental energy"", 'was caught up in creating narratives about\nwhat kind of person he was, and not so much', 'on what he did or how he behaved.', 'The thing that confused Castlereagh and confuses\nme to be honest is that Alexander had 8 or', ""10 of these narratives going through his head\nat the same time, and wasn't particularly"", 'bothered when they contradicted each other.', 'Let me give you some specific examples.', 'Alexander considered himself a true ""Enlightenment\nMonarch,"" and told anybody who would listen', 'that he believed in a limited, constitutional\nmonarchy, and wanted Russia to have elections,', 'and a parliament, and independent courts.', 'At the same time, he ruled Russia as a tyrannical\ndictator, which was justified in his mind', ""because he believed that he was God's chosen\ninstrument on Earth."", 'These two thoughts are not compatible.', 'But Alexander did not see a contradiction.', 'He would simply switch between these two modes\nof thought depending on who he was talking', 'to and how he felt that day.', ""Here's another example."", 'Alexander believed himself to be the most\nhonourable man in Europe, a man who revered', 'ritual, and tradition, and justice.', 'Simultaneously, he believed that God made\nhim Emperor of Russia for a reason, and if', 'he needed to go back on his word and use brute\nforce to implement his will, that was all', ""part of God's plan."", 'These contradictory beliefs made Alexander\nimpossible to deal with.', 'His positions came off as utterly random,\nand they could change at any time depending', 'on his mood.', 'He was unpredictable and unreliable and incomprehensible,\nparticularly bad traits for a diplomat.', 'So naturally, Alexander selected himself to\nrepresent Russia at the post-war peace conference.', 'As the most populous country in Europe, Russia\nwas a formidable land power.', 'But that inherent strength was undercut by\nweak institutions, weak governance, and the', 'fact that Russia remained a

1 or more Great Power lasted 3 months.', ""They just didn't have the room to grow into\nthe kinds of conflicts that had dominated"", 'the centuries preceding this.', 'Another way of thinking about this is through\nthe lens of military spending.', 'From the Medieval period until the 17th century,\nmilitaries accounted for on average something', 'like 90% of all government spending, with\nthe rest basically serving as a wealth transfer', 'from the poor to the aristocracy.', 'Very little money was actually spent on helping\npeople.', 'That began to change in the 17th century.', 'As states

schools of thought,\nand I'll touch on each of them now."", 'The first group are known as Realists.', 'Realists believe that the world exists in\na state of anarchy.', 'However, they also believe that within that\nanarchy, states are entirely rational, and', 'will respond rationally to incentives as they\npursue their own interests.', 'Add that all together, and it means that the\nbehaviour of states should be predictable.', 'This leads very naturally to something called\n""balance of power"" theory, which argues that', 'peace can be created through an international\nsystem built with strong incentives against', 'aggression.', 'In a well balanced international system, aggression\nfrom one state should trigger an overwhelming', 'counter-reaction from other states.', 'In a world of rational actors, this threat\nof violence should theoretically provide the', 'right incentives for peace.', 'To Realists, peace is the goal, and war is\nfailure, even though the anarchic nature of', 'the world makes peace a moving target.', 'Unfortunately, this philosophy can be used\nto justify all sorts of unspeakable behaviour.', 'A paranoid mind can misinterpret basic political\nreform as a threat to the balance of power,', 'and so at times, protecting the peace can\neasily morph into protecting the powerful.', 'In the aftermath of the French Revolution,\nthe world was dominated by Realists.', 'Just for the sake of contrast, let me briefly\nrun down the two rival theories to Realism.', 'On the opposite end of the spectrum sits,\nunsurprisingly, Idealism, maybe better known', 'as Liberalism.', 'Idealists (or Liberals) believe that peace\nis possible through political alignment.', 'They believe that when two states agree when\nit comes to politics, economics, trade, values,', 'whatever, the probability of war decreases.', 'As a consequence, some Idealists believe that\npolitical alignment is a worthy goal unto', 'itself, even if it takes a teeny tiny war\nto get there.', 'These people are known as Sickos.', 'Unlike the Realists, who believe that we live\nin an endless a state of anarchy, the Idealists', 'or Liberals believe that if we get the mix\njust right, we might be able to bring order', 'to the chaos and end war forever.', 'In this context, the French Revolution was\nan explosion of Liberalism.', 'The Revolutionaries saw the world through\nthe lens of political alignment, and went', 'so far as to say that if you were not in political\nalignment with their new French Republic,', 'then you were an enemy.', 'The Marxists came along in the mid-19th century,\nfound this Realism to Liberalism spectrum', 'wholly unsatisfying, and tried to invent a\nthird way.', 'They argue that war is simply a byproduct\nof economic inequality, and that reducing', 'that inequality produces peace.', 'The Marxists believe that this rule applies\nboth domestically and internationally, which', 'means that the actions of any individual state\nare not nearly as important as material inequality', 'across the board.', ""It's for this reason that Marxists are sometimes\nreferred to as Economic Determinists, or Materialists."", 'Marx himself says it quite plainly, ""the history\nof all hithero existing societies is the history', 'of class struggles.""', 'Full stop.', 'Realists see trouble when a strong state is\nnext to a weak state, because the world is', 'in a state of anarchy.', 'Liberals see trouble when a state with an\nopen political system is next to a state with', 'a closed political system, because the world\nis governed by political alignment.', 'Marxists see trouble when a rich state is\nnext to a poor state, because the world is', 'driven by economic inequality.', 'The thing is that all three of these statements\ncan be true, and they can even be true at', 'the same time.', 'The world is infinitely complex, no one theory\nis able to fully explain why it is as it is.', 'These are simply 3 analytical tools, and if\nyou find any of them useful, then godspeed.', 'Like I said before, the French Revolution\nwas an explosion of Liberalism, and so it', ""shouldn't come as a surprise that the reaction\nto the French Revolution was a Realist reaction."", 'In order to prevent another Great Power Conflict,\nthe victors over France thought in terms of', 'constraints.', 'With these constraints, they sought to create\na well-balanced international system, where', 'rational actors would favour peace over war.', 'That international system will be the topic\nof a future video.', 'In it, we will talk about the generation of\nleaders that were left to pick up the pieces', 'after the French Revolution, and how they\nset the stage for a century of peace.', 'Peace!!!']"

grew and grew.', 'It appears that by the end of this period,\nthe armies facing off against the Sea Peoples', 'were ten times larger than they were at the\nbeginning.', 'As I said before, towards the end of this\nperiod Egypt was pretty much the last state', 'standing.', 'Virtually all of its neighbours had fallen\nto the Sea Peoples.', 'The inscription at Medinet Habu depicts the\nfinal battle against the Sea Peoples, at the', 'mouth of the Nile.', 'Look at how the inscription emphasizes how\nlarge the Egyptian army had become.', ""Here's a row of spearmen, and then a row of\narchers, and

wall out of ships, each loaded with archers.', ""We're also told that every spearman in Egypt\nwas in position and waiting for the Sea Peoples"", 'to landed on shore.', 'The inscription at Medinet Habu tells us the\nresult of the battle.', 'Here are some Sea Peoples taken captive and\nbeing lead away.', 'Here is some unspeakable carnage.', 'Of course this is a piece of Egyptian propaganda,\nbut we have no reason to doubt that this was', 'the result.', 'After so many incredible successes, the Sea\nPeoples were finally defeated in Egypt.', 'But even in victory, Egypt suffered.', 'From this moment forward Egypt was a second-rate\npower, and even after a thousand years it', 'had not yet fully recovered.', 'The fact that Egypt was so badly damaged by\nthe collapse of international trade is a clue.', 'There has to be more to the story than the\nSea Peoples.', 'Scholars have been pulling at this thread\nfor the last few decades, and the evidence', 'is convincing.', 'Bronze Age civilizations needed bronze.', 'Obviously.', 'Without a constant supply, many of their cutting-edge\ntechnologies began to deteriorate.', 'Bronze is made by combining 9 parts copper\nwith 1 part tin.', ""Copper is a relatively common metal, but it's\ndifficult to mine."", 'Most of these Bronze Age civilizations ran\ntheir own small mining operations, but the', 'real action was in Cyprus.', 'Cyprus was absolutely swimming in copper,\nand mining it was dead easy.', 'This transformed the island into a fabulously\nwealthy hub of international trade.', 'That brings us to tin.', ""Tin is funny, because it's actually extremely\nrare, and it's not evenly distributed across"", 'the Earth.', ""There was a tiny tin mine in Anatolia, controlled\nby the Hittites, but it didn't produce nearly"", 'enough to supply the entire region.', ""After that, there weren't that many options."", 'The next closest major source was all the\nway over in modern Afghanistan, more than', '3,000 kilometers away.', 'You can just imagine how expensive and dangerous\nit was to haul tin all the way from Afghanistan', 'to Cyprus.', 'There were alternative sources, but it was\ntough.', ""There was a smaller mine in Italy, and another\nsmall mine in Spain, but these alone couldn't"", 'meet demand.', ""There wasn't another deposit on the scale\nof the Afghanistan mine until you get all"", 'the way to Cornwall on the Island of Britain.', 'It might shock you to learn that people actually\nmade this trip.', 'It was a risky voyage, but if you made it\nback it was worth it.', 'So as you can see, any disruption in this\nsupply chain meant that it was no longer possible', 'for Bronze Age civilizations to produce bronze.', 'Which by very definition was a problem.', 'So the argument goes that the Sea Peoples\nattacks disrupted international trade, slowed', 'down the production of bronze, and weakened\nevery state in the region.', 'It was a vicious cycle.', 'More attacks meant less trade.', 'Less trade made everybody even more vulnerable\nto additional attacks.', 'As the Bronze Age states collapsed, the situation\ngrew more and more dire.', 'But there might have been more to this story.', 'Even if you put the whole international trade\nangle to the side, this entire region may', 'have been much weaker than it seemed.', 'According to experts, the migration of the\nSea Peoples coincided with a 50-year period', 'where Western Asia was riddled with massive\nearthquakes.', ""I'm no scientist, but that seems bad."", ""It's possible that these earthquakes were\nabsolutely wrecking the economy in the region."", 'Some of the cities that were abandoned for\nmysterious reasons may have in fact been abandoned', 'after a seismic event.', ""There's at least some evidence of earthquakes\ndestroying cities in Greece, Anatolia, the"", 'Levant, and Cyprus.', 'Greece seems to have got the worst of it.', 'Egypt got off easy, which is an interesting\nfact considering that they were the only major', 'state left standing.', 'Maybe the earthquakes played a role.', 'So what brought the Sea Peoples here?', 'For a long time, scholars guessed that some\nkind of famine in northern Europe caused a', 'domino effect of southward migrations, culminating\nwith the Sea Peoples packing up and fleeing', 'across the Mediterranean Sea.', 'This always made sense on paper, but there\nwas very little evidence to support this theory.', 'Until now.', 'We now know that around this time there was\nsome kind of environmental emergency.', 'It turns out that, as predicted, northern\nEurope was badly affected by this, which would', 'have caused that domino effect.', 'But the surprising thing is that the effects\nwere even more severe in the eastern Mediterranean.', 'We now have ancient pollen samples from northern\nSyria, which seem to point towards a ""dry', 'event"" lasting for 300 years, beginning just\nbefore the Bronze Age Collapse.', 'Pollen samples have also been taken from Cyprus,\nwhere things were even worse.', 'These samples indicate that environmental\nchanges were so severe in Cyprus that there', 'was no longer enough rainfall to sustain even\nbasic agricultural activity.', 'This would have been catastrophic.', 'It may explain why some of the cities were\nabandoned before the Sea Peoples came.', 'Similar things have been found in the Levant,\nAnatolia, and Greece.', ""In fact, in Greece there's evidence that over\nhundreds of years, plants that were evolving"", 'to survive a desert-like environment.', 'Some of the letters we find in the city of\nUgarit support this finding.', 'Apparently during one of the invasions there\nwere crop failures across the entire Hittite', 'Empire.', 'One letter to from the Hittite King to the\nKing of Ugarit makes an urgent request for', 'grain, ending with ""it is a matter of life\nand death!""', ""There's another letter from the nearby city\nof Emar, written during one of the later invasions."", 'It reads,

reports of an environmental emergency\nare true, and we think they are, the Bronze', 'Age civilizations may have been in a state\nof crisis before the Sea Peoples even arrived.', 'The best current analysis of the Bronze Age\nCollapse has landed on something called the', 'Systems Collapse Theory.', 'According to the Systems Collapse Theory,\nthe arrival of the Sea Peoples was actually', 'a

climate had resulted in widespread\nfamine across the region.', 'This resulted in the depopulation of key cities.', 'The famine and the depopulation then lead\nto internal instability, where some local', 'populations rose up and overthrew their ruling\nclasses.', 'We have evidence that this happened with some\nfrequency over this period, especially in', 'Greece.', 'These factors and the Sea Peoples invasions\ncaused a collapse in the international trade', 'system, which just made everything all the\nworse.', 'Oh yeah, and the region was absolutely riddled\nwith earthquakes.', 'The Bronze Age civilizations in Western Asia\nwere dealing with 5 crises at once, with each', 'crisis creating a multiplier effect for all\nthe other ones.', 'And then the Sea Peoples came.', ""We still don't

General John Cook had charged\nthe King with being a tyrant, a traitor, and', 'a murderer.', 'These would be tough charges to prove against\na head of state, but fortunately the King', 'would not be present to advocate in his own\ndefense.', 'Cook decided to really focus the testimony\non whether or not Charles was a traitor, since', 'it seemed obvious that the questions of tyranny\nand murder would follow naturally from that.', 'At the time, the traditional definition of\nthe word treason was when somebody took up', 'arms against their King.', 'But the House of Commons and the High Court\nof Justice had gone to great lengths to argue', ""that that a state's power emanated not from\nthe King, but from the people."", 'Think about this.', ""If the King was the embodiment of the state,\nand the state's power came from the people,"", 'then attacking the people was kinda like attacking\nthe King.', 'This was the core tenet of Popular Sovereignty.', 'Taking this to its logical conclusion, Solicitor\nGeneral John Cook believed that all they had', 'to do was prove that the King had taken up\narms against his own people.', 'Pretty simple.', 'Cook began bringing forward a steady stream\nof witnesses to testify against the King.', 'The next day, the High Court of Justice continued\nhearing from witnesses in the Painted Chamber.', 'Again, the King was not present.', 'In the end, 33 people provided testimony.', 'Each told the tribunal that over the course\nof the Civil War, the King had personally', 'ordered deadly attacks against the English\npeople.', 'That was it.', 'In the end, the case was actually quite simple.', 'Solicitor General John Cook believed that\nsince the English people were sovereign, this', 'was enough to prove treason and tyranny.', 'And since these orders had resulted in tens\nof thousands of deaths, it was also enough', 'to prove murder.', 'The members of the High Court of Justice served\nas both judges and jury.', 'Among themselves, here in the Painted Chamber\naway from the public, they decided that the', 'King was guilty.', 'Oliver Cromwell pulled off with a small group\nof allies to write up a death sentence.',

'Anybody who signed this document would be\nguilty of treason and be put to death.', 'Cromwell and his allies stayed late into the\nevening making threats, making promises, anything', 'they could think of.', 'In the end, they went from 46 names to 59\nnames.', '59 was still far short of an absolute majority,\nbut the legislation establishing the tribunal', ""had been careful to say that they didn't actually\nneed an absolute majority."", ""Some have argued - and I'm inclined to believe\nthis - that 59 was an important benchmark"", 'because it represented a majority of those\nwho had actually shown up to the trial.', 'This would be enough to satisfy the public.', 'On the sixth day, the High Court of Justice\nmet back in the original hall in Westminster.', 'Today, the King was invited back to his own\ntrial.', 'When Charles entered the room, the soldiers\nmet him with cries of ""Justice!"" and ""Execution!""', ""The day's proceedings began, as usual, with\na long speech from Lord President Bradshaw."", 'The King cut in and asked if he could speak.', 'Bradshaw replied, ""you may answer in your\ntime.', 'Hear the court first.""', 'The King pressed on, ""it is only a word, a\nsudden judgement...""', 'Bradshaw cut the King off, telling him that\nhe must hear the court first.', 'Bradshaw continued his speech, saying, in\npart, that the King was charged with ""treason', 'and other high crimes exhibited against him\nby the people of England.""', ""A woman's voice rang out from the gallery."", '""It is a lie!', 'Not a quarter of them!""', 'Another woman joined in, ""Oliver Cromwell\nis a traitor!""', 'It was the Lady Fairfax again, but this time\nshe had a friend with her.', 'They were both wearing disguises.', 'Orders were given, and soldiers pointed their\nmuskets at the crowd.', 'The room fell into chaos.', 'The two women escaped in the confusion.', 'Can I just say that wearing a disguise to\na trial and then calling one of the judges', 'a traitor is just so awesome.', 'When order was restored, Bradshaw resumed\nhis speech.', 'He said that the tribunal had already agreed\nupon the sentence, which would be read momentarily,', 'but if the King would like to make a speech\nin his own defense, now would be the time.', 'Bradshaw was laying a clever trap.', 'The phrase ""in his own defense"" was key.', 'If the King laid out a formal legal defense\nnow, it would be an implicit acknowledgement', 'of the legitimacy of the court.', ""But Charles didn't fall into the trap."", 'He said that he worried not for his own life,\nbut rather for his conscience, for his honour,', 'and for the peace of the Kingdom.', 'If you read between the lines, this was a\nthreat.', 'Charles continued.', 'He had an offer.', 'A compromise.', 'He would agree here and now to a formal trial\nbefore Parliament.', 'He had never recognized the legitimacy of\nthe High Court of Justice, but they could', 'all recognize the legitimacy of Parliament.', 'There, the King would willingly subject himself\nto a fair public trial.', 'The members of the tribunal had not anticipated\nthis.', 'The King was finally negotiating.', 'Nobody wanted another Civil War.', 'The offer was tempting.', 'But it was a trick.', 'When the King said Parliament, he meant both\nhouses of Parliament.', ""The House of Commons remained sharply divided\nover the King's trial."", 'The original vote to establish the tribunal\nhad only been 26 to 20.', 'Quite narrow.', 'On top of this, the House of Lords had always\nbeen against it.', 'If there was a trial before the House of Commons\nand the House of Lords, chances were pretty', 'good that the King would be found innocent.', 'This was a really clever gambit.', 'It had the appearance of fairness, which was\npersuasive to those who were on the fence.', 'One member of the tribunal, John Downes, spoke\nup.', ""He had been one of the very last people to\nsign the King's death warrant."", 'One of the people that Cromwell had threatened\nlate last night.', 'Now, he spoke in favour of the King\'s request,\n""have we hearts of stone?', 'Are we men?""', 'The people around him told him to be quiet,\none whispering that he was putting his own', 'life in danger.', 'Downes raised his voice, ""if I would die for\nit, I must do it!""', 'Cromwell was angry, and rushed over to Downes\'s\nside whispering loudly, ""What do you mean', 'to do?', 'Cannot you be quiet?""', 'Downes continued, growing even louder, ""sir\n- no - I cannot be quiet!""', 'Downes jumped to his feet and continued shouting.', 'Cromwell gave Bradshaw a signal, and the Lord\nPresident adjourned the trial.', 'The members of the tribunal retreated to an\nanteroom.', 'A half hour later, the trial resumed.', ""Downes's seat was empty."", 'The King continued making his request for\na trial before Parliament.', 'When he was done, Bradshaw launched into yet\nanother extremely long speech.', 'He concluded by calling the King a tyrant,\na traitor, and a murderer.', 'The King realized that Bradshaw was going\nto just ignore his request.', 'He cut in, ""I only desire a word, before you\ngive sentence.""', 'Bradshaw pressed on.', '""For all which crimes and treasons this Court\ndoth adjudge that he, the said Charles Stuart,', 'as a tyrant, traitor, murderer, and public\nenemy to the good people of this nation, shall', 'be put to death by the severing of his head\nfrom his body.""', 'Charles tried to speak once more, but he was\npulled out of the room.', 'The trial was over.', 'The King had been sentenced to death.', 'At the time of the trial of Charles I, there\nwas a tradition in England that went back', 'at least 100 years that went a little something\nlike this: when the Crown and Parliament could', 'not agree, the monarchy was tightly constrained\nby the law.', 'But when the Crown and Parliament agreed,\nthe English monarchy was among the most powerful', 'institutions on Earth.', 'Part of this was propaganda, but it contained\nwithin it the seeds of Popular Sovereignty.', 'Charles I had never agreed with this philosophy.', 'He believed that relying on popular support\ndiminished the powers of the Crown.', 'As a consequence, he had ruled as an authoritarian.', 'But after 11 years under an authoritarian\nKing, the people of England rose up and declared', 'that that sovereignty lie not with the Crown,\nbut with the people.', 'Quite literally a revolutionary idea at the\ntime.', 'King Charles I was put to death on January\n30th, 1649.', 'At his execution he spoke at length about\nthe proper role of Parliament, telling the', 'crowd that ""a subject and a sovereign are\nclean different things!""', 'That had been true in the past, but now it\nwas no longer the case.', 'Popular Sovereignty had come to England, which\nmeant that it was now possible for monarchs', 'to commit crimes against their own people.']"

argued that the court had an obligation\nto provide adequate notice to his clients,', 'even though they were, you know, rats.', 'The judge reluctantly agreed, and issued an\norder instructing every rat in the diocese', 'to appear in court.', 'This time, notices would be posted everywhere.', 'Several days later, Chassenée showed up to\ncourt for a second time, and again, his clients', 'were nowhere to be seen.', 'The judge was prepared to call it quits right\nthere, but Chassenée came back with another', 'argument.', 'He said that whenever farmers appeared in\ncourt, they were usually

that', 'was so clearly just an act of nature?', 'Believe it or not, to answer this question\nwe have to go all the way back to the ancient', 'Greeks.', 'Murder trials in ancient Greece were held\nout in the open air.', 'Every flavour of murder trials.', 'By that I mean human murder trials, inanimate\nobject murder trials, and yes, animal murder', 'trials.', 'The principle at work here is that the

'falling roof tile, or a kick from an animal.', 'In each of these scenarios it would have been\nclassified as a murder, and each murder would', 'have emitted unseen pollution into the community.', 'If enough of this unseen pollution built up\nover time, it might result in a plague, or', 'a crop failure, or a natural disaster.', 'The fate of the entire community depended\nkeeping this pollution to a minimum.', 'So how could they do this?', 'Simple.', 'Murderous inanimate objects and animals were\nput through a formal trial, and if found guilty,', 'they were expelled beyond the borders of the\ncity.', 'This act of expulsion was thought to cleanse\nthe city of its unseen pollution.', 'This tradition persisted for a long time.', 'It eventually spread to the Roman world where\nit came into contact with the early Church.', 'Flash forward to Medieval Europe.', 'By this time the Church still believed that\nanimals could commit crimes, but the rationale', 'had evolved.', 'Like the Greeks, the Medieval Church believed\nthat the act of murder somehow infected the', 'entire community.', 'However, their version of this came not in\nthe form of an unseen pollution, but instead', 'in the form of evil forces.', 'Sometimes this evil was explicitly described\nas demonic or Satanic, and sometimes it was', 'a little more vague.', ""To put it simply, the Medieval Church's position\nwas that evil attracted evil."", 'One murder brought evil forces into the community,\nwhich made a second murder more likely.', 'A second murder did the same, and made a third\nmurder more likely.', 'It was a vicious cycle that had the potential\nto destroy an entire community.', 'So how did animals play into this?', 'For theological reasons, the belief was that\nanimals were slightly more susceptible to', 'evil than humans were.', 'When an animal committed a violent act, it\nwas an early indication that worse things', 'were in store for the community.', 'Whereas animal trials in

just\nmeans King.', ""To be clear, this person wasn't really the\nking, this was just a throwback title left"", 'over from an old forgotten monarchy.', 'The Basileus officiated religious festivals\nand performed important sacrifices.', 'The symbolic connection to the old monarchy\nmade this a prestigious position, even though', 'politically it was virtually powerless.', 'The second

Very Rich, the Moderately Rich,\nand Everybody Else.', 'So, Solon used these four classes to inform\nthe make-up of his new council, allowing each', 'class to appoint 100 men to the Boule.', 'The fact that 300 of the 400 members were\nappointed by rich people was by design.', 'Make no mistake, this was aristocracy by another\nname.', ""We don't exactly know how people got appointed\nto this

were instead elected by the people.', 'Each of the four economic classes held its\nown election.', ""Poor Athenians couldn't be candidates themselves,\nbut they could vote for rich people who alligned"", 'with their interests.', 'The 10 candidates from each class with the\nmost votes were all mixed together into one', 'group of 40.', 'Of these 40 candidates, 9 names were picked\nat random, and these people became the Basileus,', 'Polemarch, Eponymous Archon, and the 6 Junior\nArchons.', 'Again, this system was stacked in favour of\nthe rich, but it was a step in the right direction.', 'At the time, the Athenians justified the randomness\nin these elections with with piety, saying', 'that they always liked to give the final say\nto the gods.', 'In practice, this was a pretty simple way\nto reduce the influence of money in politics,', 'since no amount of bribery could ever guarantee\na result.', 'Under this new democracy, Athenian politics\nflourished.', 'Pretty quickly, three major factions emerged,\neach vying for power.', 'First, there was the Plains Faction.', 'These people tended to be rich landowners,\nwho lived on the plains outside of the city.', 'The Plains Faction were the remnants of the\nold landed aristocracy.', 'Consequently, they fought to preserve the\nprerogatives of the rich, and opposed any', 'further political reforms.', 'As landowners, they worked to protect their\nprofits by opposing any initiatives that would', 'lower the price of food.', 'Next, there was the Hill Faction.', 'People in the Hill Faction lived on the hills\nin and around the city.', ""The hills were pretty lousy places to live,\nsince you couldn't really farm or build very"", 'much on them.', 'This faction consisted of the poorest citizens,\nwho, up until recently, had been locked out', 'of the political process.', 'They loved the political reforms, and favoured\nany initiatives that would further improve', 'their standard of living.', 'Obviously the Plains Faction and the Hill\nFaction did not like each other.', 'The third faction was the Coast Faction.', 'The area near the coast was a bustling economic\nzone, full of artisans, and manufacturing,', 'and lots of trade.', 'This faction included both rich and poor citizens,\nbut what united them was the fact that their', 'livelihoods depended on trade with the outside\nworld.', 'The Coast Faction was cosmopolitan and reform-minded,\nbut above all they were interested in making', 'money.', 'In order to get the Coast Faction on board\nwith the new Athenian democracy, Solon offered', 'Athenian citizenship to any foreign-born skilled\nprofessional that wanted to move to the city', 'with their family.', 'The Coast Faction loved this policy, and it\nhelped propel Athens into an economic boom.', ""But as I've said, Athens wasn't a full democracy\nyet."", 'The system was still institutionally biased\ntowards the rich, which over time, created', 'a bunch of unforeseen problems.', 'The three factions hated each other, and it\nwas increasingly difficult to get anything', 'accomplished.', 'Also, despite the safeguards built into the\nsystem, a series of strongmen found it a easy',

'It now seemed clear that there was going to\nbe a battle.', 'Caesar assembled his legions, and sent his\n4,000 cavalry forward to screen his infantry', 'as they advanced.', 'The cavalry walked right

messenger to to Labienus, telling him', 'to abandon the plan and come back to camp.', 'The next day, Caesar finally had to acknowledge\nthat his army was down to 2 more days of food.', 'Some of his Gallic allies had been promising\na food shipment for a while now, but these', 'were Gauls of questionable loyalty, and so\nfar none had arrived.', 'But there was an allied Gallic outpost nearby,\nand

believe that from a purely military perspective\nit signaled the end of the medieval era.', 'It brought into focus some of the trends that\nwere just beginning to emerge, that would', 'continue for the next 500 years.', 'This turning point was the Battle of Agincourt,\non October 25th, 1415.', 'This battle was small part of the Hundred\nYears War between England and France.', 'King Henry V of England had invaded with a\nsmall army and some unrealistic goals.', 'After a few months of campaigning and some\nvery modest success, he resolved to head to', 'English Calais, and then back across the channel.', 'As the English approached Calais, the French\narmy finally caught up with them, and perused', 'them north.', 'By this point the English were exhausted,\nand the French easily overtook them, placing', 'themselves between the English army and the\ncoast.', 'The English were now cut off, stuck in enemy\nterritory, with winter fast approaching.', 'This was a bad position, which was just going\nto deteriorate with each passing day.', ""Let's take a moment to look at the relative\nstrength of these armies."", 'The French army had around 2,400 cavalry,\n7,600 heavy infantry, 4,000 archers, 1,500', 'crossbowmen.', 'The English army had no cavalry, 1,000 heavy\ninfantry, 5,000 archers, and no crossbowmen.', 'Let me just note here that these numbers are\nhotly debated.', 'I spent some time looking into some of the\nvarious arguments, and in my opinion these', 'numbers make the most sense, but take that\nwith a grain of salt.', 'Historians who have devoted their entire careers\nto this subject have, in a way, thrown up', 'their hands in frustration.', 'This is what we do know with certainty.', 'We know what kinds of troops made up each\narmy, and we know that the English were significantly', 'outnumbered.', 'So, the English and the French squared off\nacross a muddy field.', 'This field was flanked on both sides by treelines.', 'The English were to the south, English territory\nwas to the north, and between stood the French.', 'The French arrayed themselves in three lines\nof battle.', 'The lines were mixed, but most of their cavalry\nwas placed forward, on the wings, while most', 'of their archers were held back in the third\nline.', 'The English, being outnumbered, arrayed themselves\nin one line.', 'They placed all of their heavy infantry in\nthe middle, with archers on the wings.', 'They also concealed some archers in the woods,\non both sides of the field.', 'The archers deployed defensive wooden stakes\nin front of them, which were supposed to deter', 'any direct charge and funnel enemies towards\nthe heavy infantry in the middle.', 'They were otherwise undefended.', 'The English had an unusual problem.', 'Look at the makeup of this army.', ""It's idiotic, right?"", ""They didn't do this on purpose."", 'At the beginning of the campaign, it was double\nthis size, with normal proportions, but casualties', 'and attrition left them with this lopsided\narrangement.', 'So, the two armies formed up.', 'Neither wanted to make the first move.', 'For the French, they had several thousand\nmen who had fallen behind during the march.', 'These men would be trickling in over the next\nfew days.', 'Plus, they were well supplied.', 'They could afford to wait.', 'For the English, they had created a little\nmakeshift defensive position for themselves,', ""that they didn't want to leave."", 'But, some accounts say that the English were\nout of food, which put a ticking clock on', 'their situation.', 'After a lengthy standoff, the English moved\nfirst.', 'Their archers dismantled their defensive wooden\nstakes, and carried them forward as the whole', 'army advanced.', 'The French, still content to wait, just watched\nthis happen.', 'This may have been a mistake, but we will\nnever know.', 'The English regrouped at a new forward position,\nand reconstructed their makeshift defenses.', 'This new position put the French within the\nextreme range of the English longbow.', 'Before too long the French started to get\npelted by a few arrows.', 'The French were ordered to advance.', 'The men on the front lines were immediately\nhit with unexpectedly heavy arrow fire, which', 'caused some of the units to try to pull back,\nwhile others continued to advance.', 'This caused a big mess, and the battle was\nonly minutes old.', 'The French cavalry was not discouraged, and\ncharged heroically into the arrow fire.', 'They headed straight the English archers,\nwho appeared to be in exposed positions.', 'As they advanced, the English hit them with\nvolley after volley, but soon enough the French', 'reached the English line.', 'The defensive wooden stakes did their job,\nand the first group of cavalry to reach the', 'archers found themselves impaled on the spikes.', 'Apparently this caused the horses further\nback to panic, and many of them now refused', 'to charge the archers.', 'There was some isolated hand to hand fighting,\nbut for the most part the cavalry just darted', 'back and forth in front of the English longbowmen,\nas they continued to fire.', 'After failing to regroup and mount a second\ncharge, the French cavalry turned to withdraw.', 'As they did this, chaos started to spread,\nand the withdrawal turned into a full blown', 'route.', 'All order broke down, and the the French cavalry\nuncontrollably crashed into their own heavy', 'infantry, causing general pandemonium.', 'Still under fire, the French infantry from\nthe first and second lines regrouped, and', 'then advanced.', 'Remember that the field was muddy, and was\nnow completely tore up after that failed cavalry', 'charge.', 'The infantry were weighed down in full armour,\nand had serious difficulty navigating the', 'mud.', ""They advanced at a snail's pace, and the entire\ntime the English longbowmen were doing their"", 'thing.', 'When they reached the English line, they were\ntotally exhausted, but nevertheless charged', 'the English centre.', 'The French infantry still significantly outnumbered\nthe English, and the English were forced to', 'slowly give ground.', 'As you can imagine, the English archers had\na field day with the stationary French infantry', 'at close range.', 'Despite all of this punishment, the French\ntroops continued to gain ground.', 'This fighting continued for three hours, and\nwas intense.', 'As the English longbowmen began to run out\nof arrows, they picked up swords, and went', 'to reinforce the heavy infantry.', 'The English King personally intervened and\nengaged in hand to hand fighting.', 'He actually took an axe blow to the helmet.', 'The English were fighting for their lives.', 'After hours of brutal fighting, a couple of\nFrench units broke and pulled back.', 'The English were on their toes, and immediately\npoured into the gap in the French lines.', 'This was enough.', 'The commanders of the French infantry were\nall dead, and, leaderless, individual French', 'units began to surrender to the English en\nmasse.', 'The remaining units broke, and fled.', 'The English now had thousands of prisoners,\nbut still faced the uncommitted French third', 'line.', 'They sent out a messenger, saying something\nto the effect of ""withdraw or be destroyed.""', 'The English then set about barbarically slaughtering\nthousands of their prisoners.', 'Why did they do this?', 'Maybe it was supposed to intimidate the remaining\nFrench.', ""Maybe they didn't have enough men to guard\nthe prisoners and fight at the same time."", 'Maybe they were overcome with simple bloodlust.', 'Regardless, the French third line got the\nmessage, and quietly withdrew from the field.', 'The battle was now over, and it was a stunning\nEnglish victory.', 'The French lost somewhere around 8,000 men.', 'The English lost around 100.', 'So what did this mean for world history?', 'Why was this such a big turning point?', 'This battle crystallized a couple of trends\nthat would come to redefine European warfare.', 'First, the rise of projectile weapons.', 'Gunpowder was around, but its military usage\nwas not yet fully realized.', 'Agincourt gave us a peek at the world to come.', 'Shortbows, which were common before the 15th\ncentury, fired arrows that would bounce off', 'of most heavy armour.', 'Longbows, which the English were using at\nAgincourt, had an extremely long range, and', 'had the power to punch through platemail.', 'This improvement in projectile weapons was\na development that was going to continue,', 'and would only become more pronounced with\nthe widespread introduction of the flintlock', 'muskets some years later.', ""Second, heavy armour just wasn't what it used\nto be."", ""When heavy infantry couldn't move fast enough\nto engage with longbowmen or musketmen, they"", 'were transforming themselves into nothing\nmore than slowly moving targets.', 'Going forward, heavy infantry had to be paired\nwith longbowmen or musketmen in order to be', 'effective.', 'Third, the death of the cavalry charge.', ""Beginning with Agincourt, this could no longer\nevery army's the trump card."", 'Obviously mounted troops would be widely used\nand situationally effective for centuries,', 'but look at what happened here.', 'The English turned a frontal attack into a\nroute, and barely even had to come face to', 'face with the enemy.', 'This was new.', ""Cavalry couldn't be relied on as an army's\nall-purpose sledgehammer anymore."", 'Europe would spend the next couple of centuries\ntrying to adapt to this new paradigm.', 'I have a Patreon page!', ""If you're interested in donating, head on\nover to patreon.com/historiacivilis."", ""It's the best way to see my videos before\nI release

The wealth, in turn,\ncame from agricultural production, which was', 'the envy of the world, and tightly controlled\nby the state. Almost all agricultural land', 'in Egypt was royal land, and by that I mean\nthat it was personally owned by the Pharaohs.', 'The ruler of Egypt, and through them the Egyptian\nbureaucracy, had absolute control over this', 'land, and through the land, the wealth of\nthe entire country.', ""Let me give you some specific examples.

Let\'s just say that the Royal Agricultural', 'People™ provided farmers with the seeds\nthat they were supposed to plant for the season.', 'Since it was royal land, the farmers had no\nchoice but to accept.

What was\nthe point of punishing an oath breaker with', 'corporal punishment, when all the government\nwanted was to recoup their lost revenue. You', 'see? Pragmatism.', 'Believe it or not, that was just one small\naspect of Egyptian bureaucratic control.

Freedom', 'of movement was thrown out the window in the\nname of profit and productivity. To be honest,', 'this kind of reminds me of Tsarist Russia,\nwhere people needed special royal permission', 'just to move to another farm. And sometimes\nthat permission was denied.
